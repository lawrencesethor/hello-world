## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, include=FALSE}
summary(cars)
library(abind)
library(caret)
library(kableExtra)
```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(mlbench)
library(vcd)
library(lattice)
```


```{r}
library(party)
library(mvtnorm)
library(modeltools)
library(grid)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=T, fig.cap="Plot of Pressure"}
plot(pressure)
library(knitr)
kable(pressure, caption = "Relationship between Temperature and Presure")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


\newpage

```{r, fig.cap="Plot of Random Data. \\label{Normalxs}"}
xs = seq(1,5, by = 1)
ys = rnorm(5)
plot(xs, ys)

```



We can see in Figure \ref{Normalxs}

\newpage

```{r}
kable(cbind(xs, ys), caption = "Random Standard Normals")
```

```{r}
library(mlbench)
data("BostonHousing")
kable(head(BostonHousing), caption = "Boston Housing: A look at the Data")
```



## Include Code!

```{r}
# inline code!
x1 = rnorm(10)
x2 = rnorm(10, mean = -5)
xs12 = c(x1, x2)
```

The mean of the X's is `r mean(xs12)`.

```{r}
library(HSAUR3)
data(clouds)
mod1 <- lm(rainfall ~ ., data = clouds)
mod1sum <- summary(mod1)
```


The only significant variable for this model seems to be seedingyes, with the p-value being `r round(mod1sum$coeff[1,4], digits = 4)`, which is significant at the $\alpha = 0.05$ level.
